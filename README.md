### 📚 Theory
Access essential physics formulas and laws at a glance. From the expression of velocity to Newton's Laws of Motion, the Theory section offers concise explanations to guide you through the fundamentals of mechanics.

### 📝 Quiz
Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions inspired by the Romanian Baccalaureate. Choose from two challenge modes:
- **Race Against the Clock**: Answer as many questions as possible before time runs out.
- **Three Strikes**: Stay in the game until you get three questions wrong.

Track your progress and reinforce key concepts through repeated practice.

### 🔬 Simulations
Visualize the principles of motion in action through three interactive simulations:
- **Free Fall**
- **Inclined Plane Descent**
- **Motion Under Constant Force**

These simulations are designed to build intuition and deepen your understanding of classical mechanics.
